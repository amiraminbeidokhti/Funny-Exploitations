/usr/bin/autograde is a simple "setuid yetanotherroot" utility that 
automatically grades your submission for this subproblem.

It is supposed to write a file to /submit/<your_username> instructing 
the TA to assign a grade of *PASS* or *FAIL*, along with an (up to) 255 
character comment from you. It reads your comment from the file 
./user_comment, which should be created with the accompanying 
make_comment program. Note that the first 8 bytes of user_comment is an 
unsigned integer indicating the number characters that follow.

Alas, whoever implemented this program was pretty lazy and decided to 
hardcode your grade to *FAIL*.

An example file output by /usr/bin/autograde might contain the following:
	"Dear TA, please award ryan a big, fat *FAIL* for this problem. A 
	comment consisting of 31 chars from ryan follows: please don't
	actually fail me!"

Your goal is to somehow *PASS* the subproblem. Note that the TAs will 
*not* assign a passing grade if the file written to /submit looks 
suspicious (e.g., if it is too long or the username is incorrect or the 
character count is inaccurate).
