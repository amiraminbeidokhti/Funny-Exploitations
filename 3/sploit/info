HERE IS THE QUOTE:

"The most important thing to do in your life is to not interfere with somebody else's life.
The more boring a child is, the more the parents, when showing off the child, receive adulation for being good parents â€” because they have a tame child-creature in their house.
To me, absurdity is the only reality."
