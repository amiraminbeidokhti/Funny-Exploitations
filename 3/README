/usr/bin/writelog is a "setuid rotorooter" program that appends an
arbitrary message (up to 70 chars) to /home/rotorooter/sensitive.log.

As the name suggests, /home/rotorooter/sensitive.log contains some very
sensitive information; thus, it is readable and writable only by rotorooter.

Your goal is to dump the contents of /home/rotorooter/sensitive.log to
the terminal, thus learning all of the sensitive information it holds.
