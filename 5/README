/usr/bin/fancy_echo is a "setuid beetroot" program that reads text from a
file ./input.txt and echos it to the screen one character at a time, in a
manner that mimics typing on a keyboard. Echoing text in this way makes the
user appear extra l33t.

Your goal is to cause /usr/bin/fancy_echo into dropping a shell with the
permissions of beetroot; specifically, you must coerce it into running /bin/SH.
